# milo-booth
A virtual photo booth I made over Movement Control Order, the assets are easily swappable to customize for different brands. The PHP script takes a POST request and appends the user's selfie with a customizable frame, email address, name, phone number, and date created, and then an email with a hyperlink of the image will be sent to the email address provided.
